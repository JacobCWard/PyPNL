# PyPNL

[PyPNL](https://github.com/ValueFromData/PyPNL) is a probabilistic network
library in Python. The library consists of a Python API which interfaces to
underlying C/C++ inference and learning engines which do all the heavy lifting. The default engine is a forked version of
[OpenPNL](http://sourceforge.net/projects/openpnl/), the probabilistic network library developed by Intel. The API is designed in such a way that other libraries can be interfaced transparently. PyPNL comes with documentation, examples, and a test suite.

## Features

The PyPNL library has a rich set of features for **representation**, **inference**, **learning** and **actions** using probabilistic networks. 

#### Representation

- Dynamic Bayesian networks
- Markov random fields
- Limited memory influence diagrams

#### Inference

- Exact enumaration 
- Junction Tree
- Pearl
- Gibbs sampling

#### Learning

- K2
